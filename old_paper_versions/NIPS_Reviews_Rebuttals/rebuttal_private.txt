Over the last month, we have been substantially improving this paper. Many of our improvements
directly answer some of the comments by the reviewers, so we would prefer that our newest revisions
be taken into account. We are hoping to put a new version of this paper on arXiv (there is no public
version right now). Nonetheless, we understand if you and the reviewers decide to reject our
original submission based on the assumption that reading over our new changes would require another
detailed round of reviews.
