Here are the paper adjustments since the AISTATS 2017 submission (or,
equivalently, the October 016 arXiv submission). This is to help keep track of
the changes.

0. I converted things to the ICML 2017 format. This resulted in some minor
changes. I also made the appendix to be the full-width, which seems to be
standard judging from other ICML papers I've seen (from Berkeley people) and
it's also easier for us to write instead of having to force math and tables to
fit in half a page.

1. I changed x_i to be x_i^* for minibatches, because otherwise if we see x_1,
it could be the first element in the data, or the first element in the
subsampled data. The asterisk notation seems to be standard from the
bootstrapping community so I would use it here. It also addresses one of our
reviewers' concerns. Another notation change, making "E" into \mathbb{E}, this
is a clearer way of expectations (to me) but we can change it if strong
objections.

2. (Appendix) I moved part of the Gaussian mixture model to the Appendix. Let's
state the Poissons result but we shouldn't over-emphasize it. Another change:
making the appendix more organized, and also having three sub-sections, each for
the three experiments.

3. A new collaborative filtering experiment; it should be the third thing we do
(up to debate).
